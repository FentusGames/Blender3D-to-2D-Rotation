# Blender3D-to-2D-Rotation
This Python script is used for taking screenshots of 3D animations and exporting them as 2D animations. It imports the necessary libraries and sets the paths for importing and exporting files. A list of files to be rendered is then created, specifying details such as animation name, number of angles, minimum frames, frame start and end, and resolution. The script removes any existing model and sets the resolution for rendering. It then renders the animation from different angles, saves them in the specified directory, and renames the output files. Finally, the script removes the model and displays a message indicating that the process is done.<br>

Example output compiled with texture packer for use with games.<br>
